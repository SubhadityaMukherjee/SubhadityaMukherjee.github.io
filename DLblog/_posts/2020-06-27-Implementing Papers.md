Notes for papers I read? 

So I decided to stop spamming this feed with reviews of papers I read because there are too many and the main content will get hidden. So I will limit this blog to just creating the library and book notes.

As for papers -> Here is a link to my Github repository with implementations of the papers I read and my personal notes.
