## HTML and CSS
###This website was written fully using HTML and CSS. It is hosted on Github.io and all of the code is written by me. Now the question is why is this a blog post? I decided to make this website with No particular motive in mind but then finally decided to make something different. Being a college student my first priority is to learn but Learning is not possible unless you want to share. Knowledge which can help other people is, according to me, Worth it.

HTML in itself is it's Not an extremely difficult language. CSS might be a bit difficult but it is surely not an extreme jump for a beginner programmer. 
If you really want to learn how this website was made, check out this link. Since it is hosted on GitHub, I can make this code publicly available. If you have any questions either Google them or Drop me an email.

So, here it is. Of course I will be making modifications as I go along but for now please check this out.
