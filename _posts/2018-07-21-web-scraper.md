Today I made an application which would be more commonly known as a Web Scraper. Using python and a few modules like Beautiful soup and urllib. 

Most web scrapers are for a specific website but this one is a more general one where you can choose how many websites you want to search as well as what youre looking for. The text is formatted and then inserted into one single text file which you can then view and edit.

Python is an extremely powerful tool and you can literally do anything with it. 
It serves to check out Beautiful Soup. Its literally.. Beautiful
