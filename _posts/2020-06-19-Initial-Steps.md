What I started with and how I set up this blog

## How am I hosting this?
This blog is hosted on github.io using Jekyll <https://jekyllrb.com/>. All the posts are written using markdown. 

## How can I do the same? 
I followed these steps to set up this blog page and if you follow it, you can do the same :)
- Make a github account if you do not have one. And make a page there.
- Install jekyll, ruby, bundler <https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/using-jekyll-with-bundler/>
- Create a basic website or use a default config file. Name it _config.yml. Mine is [here](https://github.com/SubhadityaMukherjee/SubhadityaMukherjee.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml)
- Go to the folder and execute bundle init
- Edit the gemfile to fix dependency errors
- I am using this [theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal) which you need to install using bundler
- git add . && git commit -m "added" && git push
- DONE!!!!
