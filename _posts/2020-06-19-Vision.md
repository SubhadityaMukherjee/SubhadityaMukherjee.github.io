A roadmap of modules I want to implement. Mostly as a todo list and a help if anyone decides they want to pitch in. (LOL)

## Modules - Part1: image classification
- Dataloader for classification
- Train/test/valid split
- Gradient descent
- Some basic layers/activations
  - Linear
  - Relu, Swish
  - Softmax
- Optimizer
  - SGD
  - Adam
  - AdamW
- Some sort of easy way of defining the architecture
- Train module
- Accuracy metrics
- One cycle training
