Implementing batching for large data. Onehot and data batching. This is a precursor to everything from optimizers to the actual training loop itself.

First let us look at one hot encoding. Simply put it is encoding the labels as numbers. Should not be particularly challenging.
What do we intend to achieve? Well lets say we have "cat" "dog". All we need to do is label these as 0,1 and have a way to convert them back to "cat" "dog". 

We first identify the unique elements. Then we pop them into a dictionary of numbers from 1 to number of unique.

``` julia
labels = unique(y_enc)
encodedlabels = Dict(labels .=> collect(1:length(labels)))
```

Now that we have that out of the way, we have to map the entire list from before with these values. I thought it would be as simple as using a map but apparently not.
