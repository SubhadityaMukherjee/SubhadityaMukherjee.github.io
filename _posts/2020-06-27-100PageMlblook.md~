I decided to add notes to this blog too. All such notes will be tagged with "book" for easier search.
This one is my notes while reading "Andriy Burkov : The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book". [Amazon](http://themlbook.com/). Do support the author if you can.

A quick note on how I make notes. I first annotate the pdf of the book. And then type down the text to make it searchable. Yes I probably could use OCR but this helps me remember more. Also, this is not meant to be comprehensive reviews but only what I find interesting from the book. I read a lot about Deep Learning so these will keep popping up.

Okay now let us get to it :)

## Initial thoughts from the content
- Seems like a book which summarizes ML and tiny bit of DL
- Not in depth but more of an executive summary of sorts
- Most of the major algorithms explained in brief
- Bits of extra information scattered here and there

## Notes
- I skipped making notes of anything I knew prior. So these points are things that I wanted to read again or just found interesting while I was reading the book.
- I skipped things like linear regression while making notes so if you dont know what those are better read the book :)
