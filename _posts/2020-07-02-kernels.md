Image kernels are fun as filters, so let us just look at a few of them and maybe try something else?

Where do I get the numbers from? [Awesome blog](https://setosa.io/ev/image-kernels/)

So we start with this image

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/deconstrucImages/cam.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

# Filters

## Blur

```julia
kernel_blur = [
0.0625 0.125 0.0625;
0.125 0.25 0.125;
0.0625 0.125 0.0625
]
```
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/deconstrucImages/camdblur.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>


## Bottom Sobel

```julia
kernel_blur = [
-1 -2 -1 ;
0 0 0 ;
1 2 1
]
```

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/deconstrucImages/botsob.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

## Emboss
```julia
kernel_blur = [
-2 -1 0 ;
-1 1 1 ;
0 1 2
]
```
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/deconstrucImages/emb.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

## Identify
```julia
kernel_blur = [
0 0 0 ;
0 1 0;
0  0 0
]
```
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/deconstrucImages/iden.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

## Left Sobel
```julia
kernel_blur = [
-1 0 -1 ;
-2 0 -2;
1 0 -1
]
```
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/deconstrucImages/lesob.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

## Outline
```julia
kernel_blur = [
-1 -1 -1 ;
-1 8 -1 ; 
-1 -1 -1
]
```
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/deconstrucImages/out.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

## Right sobel
```julia
kernel_blur = [
-1 0 1 ;
-2 0 2 ; 
-1 0 1
]
```
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/deconstrucImages/rsob.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

## Sharpen
```julia
kernel_blur = [
0 -1 0 ;
-1 5 -1 ;
0 -1 0
]
```
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/deconstrucImages/shar.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

## Top sobel
```julia
kernel_blur = [
1 2 1 ;
0 0 0 ; 
-1 -2 -1
]
```
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/deconstrucImages/tsob.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

# Experiments!!

## What happens when you convolve two images of the same size??

``` julia
tmp_cm =  channelview(Gray.(testimage("house")));
tmp_cm2 = channelview(Gray.(testimage("mandrill")));
imshow(conv2d(tmp_cm2,tmp_cm))
```

I get a fully white image... Is it because the images are of the same size?
Since these convolutions are only in black and white.. I cheated a bit for the purpose of this experiment and used a library. (Obviously I will do it from scratch later or atleast try to).

``` julia
using DSP
imshow(DSP.conv(channelview(tmp_cm),tmp_cm2))
```
I want to analyze a bit more. Here are the two images
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/deconstrucImages/house.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/deconstrucImages/mandorig.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

So I get this.
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/deconstrucImages/2conv.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

I am not sure why? I can't visualize it atleast.

## Different size?

So the largest realistic kernel size I have seen is 15. So let us take this house and resize it to that and try and see what happens.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/deconstrucImages/houseconv.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

Man I have to take a second to actually appreciate the fact that we can understand this as a house. So this is what we get.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/deconstrucImages/2convm.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

Wow! That actually did something. You know, I am actually enjoying this detour. I should add more experiment sections whenever I can.
