Here we will look at the pooling operation and its types.

Okay so what is a pooling layer? Let us take this matrix.

``` julia
1 2
3 4
```

If we take max pool the output should be 4. Simple enough? That is pretty much it.

The challenge is to apply it to a whole image while taking into account different pooling sizes, different image depths (2 for gray 3 for color) as well as different strides (how many columns to move while doing a pool).

Let us get to it.

## Max pool
We first check if the image has a depth or not (aka does it have more than 2 channels). Note that most of the code remains the same for both except a few minor changes (I have to reduce the code size and remove redundancy but for the sake of this example I willl leave it as it is).

### With depth
Okay. Case 1. Where there is a depth.
We first calculate the size of the output image so we can pre allocate an array.

$$output_{height} = \frac{input_{height} - poolsize}{stride} ; output_{width} = \frac{input_{width} - poolsize}{stride}$$

Once we have that, we can allocate an array with those dimensions.

``` julia
function maxpool(img, pool_size=2,stride = 2,depth=false)

    if depth == true
        input_d , input_h, input_w = size(img)
         output_h = Integer((input_h - pool_size)/stride )
        output_w = Integer((input_w - pool_size)/stride )
    
        result = zeros(input_d,output_h, output_w)  
```

Now for the main loop. We iterate over the width and height of the output, and since we have a depth, we can use the : index (which takes all the channels) , i, j. Then we can allocate this to the maximum of the current window we are considering. 

``` julia
for i in collect(1:output_h),j in collect(1:output_w)  
            result[:, i,j] .= maximum(img[:, i*stride:i*stride+pool_size, j*stride:j*stride+pool_size])  
        end
```

### Without depth
If we do not have a depth, then we simply ignore the : and use the rest of it.

``` julia
else
        input_h, input_w = size(img)
        output_h = Integer((input_h - pool_size)/stride )
        output_w = Integer((input_w - pool_size)/stride )
    
        result = zeros(output_h, output_w)  

        for i in collect(1:output_h),j in collect(1:output_w)
            result[i,j] = maximum(img[i*stride:i*stride+pool_size, j*stride:j*stride+pool_size])
        end
      
    
    end

    return result
end
```

Now if we take our beloved mandrill and apply max pool to one channel of it.
Say pool size 10 and stride 2. (These are the actual output sizes)

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/deconstrucImages/mp1.png" alt="drawing"/>

Pool size 11, stride 1. Note that this image is bigger because our stride is lesser.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/deconstrucImages/mp2.png" alt="drawing"/>

## Average pooling

Okay how about average pooling? We just need to change a bit from the previous code. We create a view into the current window, then instead of maximum, we take the sum and divide it by the total number of elements in the window. (aka average)

``` julia
temp = @view img[:, i*stride:i*stride+pool_size, j*stride:j*stride+pool_size]

result[:, i,j] .= sum(temp)/prod(size(temp))
```

Pool size 10 and stride 1.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/deconstrucImages/ap1.png" alt="drawing"/>

See the difference? This is why max pool is more commonly used. Average pool blurs out too much of the information.
