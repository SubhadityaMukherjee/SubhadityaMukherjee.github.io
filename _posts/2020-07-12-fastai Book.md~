What I found interesting from the book "Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD"
by Jeremy Howard  (Author), Sylvain Gugger (Author)

[Link to the book](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527)

> I will not be adding any codes here as those will be part of the projects/deeper blog posts.



## General points

- If it isnt an image, you can still make it one if you are creative xD
- Train a model, then use the trained model to find errors in data. Its faster.
- Sometimes things are just not solvable using Deep Learning or do not need it
- NLP : Not that great yet
