Convert a video to low poly :) (See images below if you dont know what that is)

Just as a citation. Most of the code is from [here](https://github.com/louis-paul/polypy). I adapted it to videos and decided to explain the code because it was too cool to not.

Before we go on. This is a low poly image. 

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/poly1.png" alt="drawing" width = "400"/>

Looks really cool doesn't it? Okay so how do we go about making this. And then extend it to work with videos? Let us begin!! (Note that this will be in Python)

First let us get the libraries we need. cv2 and PIL are for loading and performing operations on images. tqdm is a fancy progress bar. colortypes is for getting the color and ctypes gives us access to the types from C. sys gives us access to the system
As for the scipy spatial, that will be explained in due course.
