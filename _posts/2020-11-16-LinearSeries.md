A brief about the next few posts on Linear Algebra.

# Why
I came to a realization recently, I have slacked off quite a lot when it comes to math. Especially because the classes were really boring and I never paid attention. Now I am at a bottleneck which I have to cross.

The next few (I dont know how many) posts will be about Linear Algebra and some very low level implementations which I hope to do.

I will mostly be following 3Blue1Brown's youtube channel + other related articles/books etc.
All resources I use will of course be mentioned here.

# Topics
The topics I mostly want to think about are :
- Linear Algebra
- Vectors
- Matrices
- Differential eqs
- Maybe Calculus
