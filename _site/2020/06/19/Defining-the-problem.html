<p>An introduction to what I want to do and why.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-i-need-to-make-a-library-from-scratch-when-there-are-so-many-out-there">Why do I need to make a library from scratch when there are so many out there?</h2>
<p>Simply put, I want to learn. And what better way to learn then by making something from scratch?</p>

<p>Another reason is that documenting the whole process will allow me to learn a lot more than I knew and will help anyone who follows this to see the process, successes and failures of the process.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-have-in-mind">What do I have in mind?</h2>
<p>I will be using Julia for this and the project will probably span as long as I keep working on it. Which hopefully will be for a long time. In the process, I will try to document what I have done, and why and explore challenges and try to implement many things along the way. Note that this is not meant to be a library which you can use right now. It is a playground.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-add-to-it">Can I add to it?</h2>
<p>Feel free to fork the project and add it to your version of the code. I do not get anything out of this except learning and sharing it with the community.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-talk-to-you-about-deep-learning">Can I talk to you about Deep Learning?</h2>
<p>YES! I would love to do that. Drop me an email at <a href="mailto:msubhaditya@gmail.com">msubhaditya@gmail.com</a> and we can talk about it. :)</p>
