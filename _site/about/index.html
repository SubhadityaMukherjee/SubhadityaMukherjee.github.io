	<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
	<p>I am Subhaditya Mukherjee, a coding enthusiast and a lover of knowledge. My thirst to create and learn has got me this far and I aim to continue this way. 		
		Feel free to email me about anything, I am always ready to talk to new people and learn something.<br>
My major interests are machine learning, artificial intelligence and basically anything which would help me be at the forefront technology and create something awesome. I fell in love with computer science because it gave me a way to express my creativity and moreover would let me create anything I wanted to. In some ways, it blurred the lines between my imagination and reality. As of now this website itself, was created after just a few hours of learning only because I was driven to learn. It all seemed so interesting, just a few lines of code and you can do anything you want to.<br><br>
