  <h2 id="html-and-css">HTML and CSS</h2>
<p>###This website was written fully using HTML and CSS. It is hosted on Github.io and all of the code is written by me. Now the question is why is this a blog post? I decided to make this website with No particular motive in mind but then finally decided to make something different. Being a college student my first priority is to learn but Learning is not possible unless you want to share. Knowledge which can help other people is, according to me, Worth it.</p>

<p>HTML in itself is itâ€™s Not an extremely difficult language. CSS might be a bit difficult but it is surely not an extreme jump for a beginner programmer. 
If you really want to learn how this website was made, check out this link. Since it is hosted on GitHub, I can make this code publicly available. If you have any questions either Google them or Drop me an email.</p>

<p>So, here it is. Of course I will be making modifications as I go along but for now please check this out.</p>
