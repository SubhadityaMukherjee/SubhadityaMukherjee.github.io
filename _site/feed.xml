&lt;p&gt;Simply put, I want to learn. And what better way to learn then by making something from scratch?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason is that documenting the whole process will allow me to learn a lot more than I knew and will help anyone who follows this to see the process, successes and failures of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-i-have-in-mind&quot;&gt;What do I have in mind?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be using Julia for this and the project will probably span as long as I keep working on it. Which hopefully will be for a long time. In the process, I will try to document what I have done, and why and explore challenges and try to implement many things along the way. Note that this is not meant to be a library which you can use right now. It is a playground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;can-i-add-to-it&quot;&gt;Can I add to it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to fork the project and add it to your version of the code. I do not get anything out of this except learning and sharing it with the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;can-i-talk-to-you-about-deep-learning&quot;&gt;Can I talk to you about Deep Learning?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YES! I would love to do that. Drop me an email at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:msubhaditya@gmail.com&quot;&gt;msubhaditya@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt; and we can talk about it. :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Subhaditya Mukherjee</name></author><category term="start" /><category term="defining" /><category term="post" /><category term="introduction" /><summary type="html">Why do I need to make a library from scratch when there are so many out there?
