<p>Notes on the book.</p>

<h2 id="things-i-liked-in-the-book">Things I liked in the book.</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The key word in this memory is novelty. Facebook didn’t arrive in our world
with a promise to radically transform the rhythms of our social and civic lives;
it was just one diversion among many.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the iPhone first shipped in 2007, there was no App Store, no social
media notifications, no quick snapping of photos to Instagram, no reason to
surreptitiously glance down a dozen times during a dinner—and this was
absolutely fine with Steve Jobs, and the millions who bought their first
smartphone during this period.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Describes the modern hyper-connected existence as one in which “a moment can feel strangely flat if it exists solely in itself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why they use Facebook, or Instagram, or Twitter, they can provide
you with reasonable answers. Each one of these services probably offers them
something useful that would be hard to find elsewhere: the ability, for
example, to keep up with baby pictures of a sibling’s child, or to use a hashtag to monitor a grassroots movement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>technologies as a whole have managed to expand beyond the minor roles for
which we initially adopted them. Increasingly, they dictate how we behave
and how we feel, and somehow coerce us to use them more than we think is
healthy, often at the expense of other activities we find more valuable. What’s
making us uncomfortable, in other words, is this feeling of losing control—a
feeling that instantiates itself in a dozen different ways each day, such as
when we tune out with our phone during our child’s bath time, or lose our
ability to enjoy a nice moment without a frantic urge to document it for a
virtual audience.
It’s not about usefulness, it’s about autonomy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“How is that a slot machine?” Cooper asks.
“Well, every time I check my phone, I’m playing the slot machine to see
‘What did I get?’” Harris answers. “There’s a whole playbook of techniques
that get used [by technology companies] to get you using the product for as
long as possible.”
“Is Silicon Valley programming apps or are they programming people?”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>connections between you and another person can impact how you feel about
each other. “If you find out you have the same birthday as someone who does
something horrible,” Alter explained to me, “you hate them even more than if
you didn’t have that information.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>this longer treatment that not only seemed particularly relevant to our
discussion, but as you’ll soon learn, repeatedly came up in my own research
on how tech companies encourage behavioral addiction: intermittent positive
reinforcement and the drive for social approval.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>information. It tends to be these early, pre-feedback-era features that people
cite when explaining why social media is important to their life. When
justifying Facebook use, for example, many will point to something like the
ability to find out when a friend’s new baby is born, which is a one-way
transfer of information that does not require feedback</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“We’re social beings who can’t
ever completely ignore what other people think of us.” This behavior, of</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our Paleolithic brain
categorizes ignoring a newly arrived text the same as snubbing the tribe
member trying to attract your attention by the communal fire: a potentially
dangerous social faux pas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to optimize the tech, or search out a better option.
By working backward from their deep values to their technology choices,
digital minimalists transform these innovations from a source of distraction
into tools to support a life well lived. By doing so, they break the spell that
has made so many people feel like they’re losing control to their screens.</p>
