<p>I want to talk about adopting animals.</p>

<p>This is so far away from my regular content, but I feel like this is a much needed discussion before I go sleep tonight.
I wont make this very long. But here are some reasons from my side why you should get animals from shelters and not “buy” them.</p>

<p><img src="https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2015/04/07/548e24ea-376d-4b6a-a04e-85c0ff584fb4/northforkshelterdog.jpg" height="300" /></p>
<ol>
  <li>Every year, around 12 million dogs and cats and kittens/puppies  are euthanized. (That means they are killed painlessly because there are too many animals and too less people to care for them).</li>
  <li>Animals are animals. They will love you no matter where you got them from.</li>
  <li>They are not “broken”. Many of them ended up there because of something like a divorce or their family moving. Seeing how attached animals get….</li>
  <li>If you want to look at it from a cost point of view, it will actually cost you less because the adoption price actually covers a lot.</li>
  <li>Because your pet is not “manufactured”. Yes. This happens.<a href="https://www.aspca.org/barred-from-love/puppy-mills-101">Link</a>.  Oh and they are really cruel. Still want to promote it?</li>
  <li>Because you saved a life. <img src="https://www.adoptapet.com/blog/uploads/2014/04/take-us-home-kittens.jpg" height="150" /></li>
  <li>Oh and if you adopt one pet, it helps more who now have a better chance at getting adopted.</li>
  <li>Most of them are already housetrained so that takes care of it</li>
  <li>We hurt animals so much. Rarely do you hear of any of them hurting a human back without being provoked. So why do we continue?</li>
  <li>Others will follow your example.</li>
  <li>Show people that there is nothing wrong with a pet who needs a little more love.</li>
  <li><strong>You will give an animal who has received nothing but hatred, a life and a home. And you will have changed its whole world.</strong></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>I will get a shelter puppy when I get one. I hope you do the same.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is a dog who needed a little more love. Just watch it :)</p>
